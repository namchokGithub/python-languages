# Built in math fuctions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable
y = min(5, 10, 15)
x = min(2, 10, 15)
print(x)
print(y)

# The match module
import math
x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)

# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, 
# and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result
x = math.ceil(1.4)
y = math.floor(1.4)
print(x) # returns 2
print(y) # returns 1

# PI
x = math.pi
print(x)
